    <h2>Who am I?</h2>
  <p>Hi! I am Kernita Sylvester. I am using this page to learn how to code a web page efficiently. This lowkey reminds me of issuing commands via MS-dos on the old school computers.</p>
    <p>I also like to exercise and gain back the weight by eating out and drinking deicious cocktails. Then I complain about my weight. It's a viciosuj cycle that I have gone through my entire life.</p>
